## HERE Web Coding Challenge
Hi, as part of the "getting to know each other" process, we'd like you to work on a small project which is hopefully a bit of fun.  This is a chance for you to show off your coding skills and to play with our mapping API.


#### Project description
Build a web application for displaying a route from an itinerary on a map using the HERE Map APIs.  You can read about our map APIs on developer.here.com.


##### User stories
* As a user, I want to search (using the HERE search API) for places or addresses and see a list of results.
* As a user, I want to add individual search results to an itinerary.
* As a user, I want to be able to search multiple times and add results from each search to a single itinerary.
* As a user, I want to see a route on a map when I am finished creating the itinerary.
* As a user, I want to remove waypoints from the itinerary list.
* As a user, I want to change the order of the stops in the itinerary so that I can change the itinerary without starting over completely.


##### Constraints
* It should not take more than 2-3 evenings.
* You should target modern desktop browsers (IE10+, Firefox, Chrome).
* You should use HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and AngularJS as the client framework.
* The finished application should be available to us on the Internet. 
* The source code should also be available for us to see on a public site e.g. GitHub, Dropbox, etc.
* The application should need little or no backend code.
 
##### Bonus Points
If you want to REALLY impress us, keep reading:
* Allow sharing of the route to other users (e.g. creating a sharable URL)
* Allow the user to choose (and optionally compare) the mode of transport (walk,drive,PT)
* Unit tests (we love TDD!)
* Responsive design


Finally, have FUN!
